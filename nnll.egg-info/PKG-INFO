# nnll <br><sub>neural network link library: Flexible code for multimodal AI apps</sub>

`nnll` (or <em>null</em>)is a toolkit for researchers and developers working with AI models like Diffusion and Large Language Models (LLMs).  It provides modular, reusable, and efficient components as a foundation to simplify the process of building and managing these complex systems.

* Generative AI pipeline preparation & execution
* Extracting and classifying metadata from images/models
* Consumer-grade GPU/CPU inference optimization
* Misc UX/UI Experimentation
* 🧨Diffusers, 🤗Transformers, 🦙Ollama, 🍏MLX, 🌀DSPy, 🚅LiteLLM
* :shipit: <br><br>
