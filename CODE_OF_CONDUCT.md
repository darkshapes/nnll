## Behavior Guide

|              Behavior | Should Be                                                   |
| --------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Damaging Intentions | Identified and discouraged. Speak up!                       |
|       Honest Mistakes | No ones perfect. Pay attention to constructive feedback.    |
|     Move Fast & Break | Asking for consent and respecting when consent is denied.   |
|           Feels Wrong | Don’t do it. Take a break, clear your head. Do self care.   |
|    ’Stupid Questions’ | Impossible. No question is invalid, or too obvious.         |
| ‘Freedom of **\_\_**' | We define kindness within our community environment.        |
|       Creepy Vibes... | Unacceptable. Words and flirts CAN hurt. End coercion.      |
|   Users vs Developers | Everyone involved, anywhere. Skill DIVERSITY, not division. |

## Constructive Criticism Guide:

- Ask consent first. Don't forget to wait for the answer!
- Paraphrase, repeat, or describe the work to empathize with the other person.
- Discuss what’s working, what is helpful, and what you want more of.
- Talk candidly about shortcomings. Be polite. Plant seeds for growth.
- Theres rarely only one good way to do something, and everything has a drawback.

## Conflict Resolution Guide:

- Collect thoughts and emotions before the impulse to act rashly.
- Be authentic. This process is always awkward. That’s okay.
- Set boundaries clearly. You are encouraged to enforce them.
- Use “I” instead of “You. Set aside expectations or assumptions of others.
- Express feelings and release them without dwelling. Let it be cathartic, and then over.
- Patience. Everyone feels ready to leave something behind at their own speed.

> Remember: Designs mirror creator relationships. Treat others to the same service you want to build.
