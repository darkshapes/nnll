# nnll

## neural network link library
`nnll` (or <em>null</em>) is a comprehensive AI toolkit for managing and processing Diffusion and Large Language Models (LLMs). The project is divided into highly modular, ready-to-use components, and may appeal to researchers or developers working in the general field of machine learning.

Library compatibility includes ðŸ§¨Diffusers, ðŸ¤—Transformers, ðŸ¦™Ollama, and focuses on refining methods for tasks such as extracting and classifying metadata, pipeline preparation, GPU configuration, consumer-grade system optimization, and a variety of direct and indirect generative AI preparations.

## use
Some modules are full scripts and can be run from command line. These are written here:

`nnll-parse`   - Process metadata headers from a model file or directory of models and write out to individual .json files.<br>
`nnll-find`    - Scan .json files from `-parse` for string patterns within tensor layer metadata and output matches to console.<br>
<br>

## specifics

Each module contains 1-5 functions or 1-2 classes and its own test routines. There are multiple ways to integrate nnll into a project (sorted by level of involvement)

- *Recommended* : Install the project as a dependency via `nnll @ git+https://github.com/darkshapes/nnll`
- Install the entire project as a dependency via `nnll @ git+https://github.com/darkshapes/nnll`
- Basic clone or fork of the project
-  Use a [submodule](https://github.blog/open-source/git/working-with-submodules/)
- [Filter](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/) a clone of the project to a single subfolder and include it in your own


`nnll` is a 'living' project. Like a spoken language, it evolves over time. For this reason, we prefer 'living' duplications of the repo. If you still want a static hard copy, you are welcome to copy and paste folders or code wherever you please.
